### A simple list app with Html CSS & Typescript
A simple list app with HTML, CSS, Vanila JS and Typescript. 
This app is implemented with typescript OOP where I make good use of best class practices and decorators.

## Set up
- Clone the repo
- Run npm install to install all dependencies
- Install Typescript either in an virtualenv or globally on your machine using. This will help auto generate Javascript files interpreted by typescript. The javascript version set is ES6 hence the resulting JS code will be ES6
- Use `npm install -g typescript` to install typescript globally or
- Use `npm install typescript --save-dev` to install typescript in your project. I installed typescript globally.
- Start the typescript watcher to watch all changes in the .ts files by running `tsc -w`
- Once you have the tsc server running, run `npm run start` to start the development server.

## Hosting
- We will use netlify to host this app once ready
